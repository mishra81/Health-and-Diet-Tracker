# FitTrack: Health and Diet Tracker

FitTrack is a full-stack Health and Diet Tracker built with Laravel 12, PHP 8, SQLite/MySQL, Blade, Tailwind CSS, Laravel Breeze authentication, Eloquent ORM, RESTful controllers, Laravel Sanctum APIs, and Chart.js analytics.

The goal of this project is to help users track their health and fitness journey from one dashboard. Users can manage meals, calories, macros, workouts, weight goals, BMI, water intake, and diet recommendations. Admin users can manage users, diet plans, exercises, and view platform-level statistics.

## Project Objective

Many people struggle to maintain fitness goals because their meal logs, workouts, body metrics, and progress are scattered across different tools. This project solves that problem by providing a centralized web application where users can:

- Track daily meals and calories.
- Track protein, carbs, and fat intake.
- Track workouts and calories burned.
- Monitor BMI and weight changes.
- Set weight loss, weight gain, or maintenance goals.
- View dashboard analytics.
- Get diet recommendations based on BMI, goal type, activity level, and dietary preference.
- Track daily water intake.
- Use an admin panel for managing users, diet plans, and exercise records.

## Code Architecture

This project follows Laravel MVC architecture.

### Models

Models represent database tables and relationships.

Location:

```text
app/Models
```

Examples:

- `User.php`
- `Profile.php`
- `Meal.php`
- `Workout.php`
- `Goal.php`
- `DietPlan.php`

### Controllers

Controllers receive requests, call models/services, and return views or JSON responses.

Location:

```text
app/Http/Controllers
```

Examples:

- `DashboardController.php`
- `MealController.php`
- `WorkoutController.php`
- `GoalController.php`
- `WaterIntakeController.php`

### Form Requests

Form request classes handle validation.

Location:

```text
app/Http/Requests
```

Examples:

- `ProfileUpdateRequest.php`

Validation examples:

- Calories must be numeric.
- Weight must be positive.
- Password must be confirmed.
- Email must be unique.
- Workout duration must be at least 1 minute.

### Services

Services keep business logic separate from controllers.

Location:

```text
app/Services
```

Services:

- `HealthMetricService`: calculates BMI and BMI category.
- `AnalyticsService`: prepares chart data for the dashboard.
- `DietRecommendationService`: recommends diet plans.

### Views

Blade views handle the frontend UI.

Location:

```text
resources/views
```

Main view folders:

- `auth`
- `profile`
- `meals`
- `workouts`
- `goals`
- `water-intakes`

```

## REST API

The project includes Sanctum-based API authentication.

Public endpoints:

```text
POST /api/register
POST /api/login
```

Authenticated endpoints:

```text
POST /api/logout
GET /api/user
GET /api/analytics
```

Meal API:

```text

PUT /api/workouts/{workout}
DELETE /api/workouts/{workout}
```

Goal API:

```text
GET /api/goals
POST /api/goals
GET /api/goals/{goal}
PUT /api/goals/{goal}
DELETE /api/goals/{goal}
```

Use this header for authenticated API requests:

```text
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Security Features

- Laravel Breeze authentication
- Secure password hashing
- CSRF protection for web forms
- Sanctum token authentication for APIs
- Email verification
- Middleware-protected routes
- Admin routes protected with `access-admin` gate
- Validation through Form Request classes
- Blade escaping to reduce XSS risk

```

Install PHP dependencies:

```powershell
composer install
```

Install Node dependencies:

## Running the Project

Open one VS Code terminal and run:

```powershell
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
```

Open a second VS Code terminal and run:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open the application:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000

```

## Presentation Flow

Use this flow when presenting to a teacher or class:

1. Open the landing page and explain the project objective.
2. Login as the user account.
3. Show the dashboard cards: calories, weight, BMI, burned calories, water, and workout streak.
4. Show Chart.js analytics.
5. Add a meal and explain calorie and macro tracking.
6. Add a workout and explain burned calorie tracking.
7. Open goals and explain goal progress.
8. Open water tracker and explain the hydration progress bar.
9. Open diet recommendations and explain the recommendation logic.
10. Logout and login as admin.
11. Show admin dashboard, user management, diet plan management, and exercise management.
12. Explain that the backend also includes REST APIs through Sanctum.

## Code Explanation for Presentation

You can explain the code like this:

1. Laravel Breeze handles login, registration, password reset, and email verification.
2. Routes are defined in `routes/web.php` for web pages and `routes/api.php` for REST APIs.
3. Controllers handle user actions, such as adding meals or workouts.
4. Form Request classes validate all form input before saving to the database.
5. Eloquent models represent tables and define relationships.
6. Services contain reusable business logic like BMI calculation, analytics data, and diet recommendations.
7. Blade views and Tailwind CSS create the user interface.
8. Chart.js displays progress analytics on the dashboard.
9. Admin routes are protected using middleware and the `access-admin` gate.
10. Seeders create demo users, meals, workouts, goals, diet plans, and exercises.

## Testing

Run all tests:

```powershell
php artisan test
```

The test suite checks:

- Authentication
- Registration
- Password reset
- Profile update
- Meal tracking
- Dashboard calorie update

## Deployment Notes

This project should be deployed on a platform that supports PHP and databases.

Recommended hosting options:

- Railway
- Render
- DigitalOcean
- Laravel Forge
- Shared PHP hosting with MySQL

Vercel is not ideal for this project because Vercel is mainly designed for frontend and serverless JavaScript applications. This app is a full Laravel PHP application that needs a PHP runtime, database, storage, migrations, and environment configuration.

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- PDF health reports
- Dark mode toggle
- AI calorie estimator
- Food barcode or QR scanner
- Fitness streak badges
- PWA support
- Wearable device integration
- Community challenges
- Notification scheduler for meals, workouts, and water reminders

## Conclusion

FitTrack is a complete Laravel-based health tracking platform. It combines authentication, user profiles, meal tracking, workout tracking, BMI calculation, goal management, diet recommendations, water tracking, analytics, REST APIs, and an admin panel into one full-stack project.
